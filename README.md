# Offline-Signature-Recognition
Signature is one of the most important entity to recognize a person. Verification using signature of an individual can be either offline or on line based on the nature of application.For online signature verification systems the signatures are capture at run time means at the time the signature is made.Online verification is much costly as compare to offline. 

The offline systems need scanned images of signatures. Our method of research is offline signature verification using a simple shape based geometric features, global features and texture features of scanned image. The geometric features that are used are Aspect Ratio, Normalized Area, Center of Gravity and the Slope of the line joining the Centers of Gravity of two halves of a signature image. The global features are Image Cropping, Maximum Horizontal Projection, Maximum Vertical Projection, and Edge Point Calculation. Before extracting the features, preprocessing of a scanned image is necessary to isolate the signature part and to remove any spurious noise present. The system is initially trained using a database of signatures obtained from those individuals whose signatures have to be authenticated by the system. Feedfarward neural net is used for our system verification process.
